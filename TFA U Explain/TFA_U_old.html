            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>This guide introduces you to the TFA (Terms for ANKI) and U (Understand) methods. Learning new things, especially complex concepts in computer science and engineering, can sometimes feel overwhelming. But what if there was a way to not only learn but truly understand and remember what you've learned for a long time? That's where the TFA (Terms for ANKI) and U (Understand) methods come into play. Let's dive into these two powerful strategies and see how they can transform the way you study.</p>

            <h2>WARNING! Note from me (2025):</h2>
            <p>This guide is over <strong>2 years old</strong>. Information is NOT reliable but might be useful. <br><br>The approach written on this webpage is my old view on how to study efficiently, but I think the method is not generalized properly and takes too much time. So if this tedious method is good for your use case, feel free to use it. <br><br>Below I added two links that contain up-to-date PDFs with more generalized and important information. The first one contains a summary of Colin Galen's view on how to learn to understand hard concepts. The second is more focused on ADHD how to plan and stay aware. I'll add more documents later focusing more on the Cognitive Science side, which is arguably more useful directly. If you want to learn how to study seriously, i recommend read it through!</p>

                <h2>What is TFA?</h2>
                <p>TFA stands for Terms for ANKI. It's a method that helps you remember the big picture of what you're learning. But before we get into TFA, let's talk about Anki.<br><br>
                    What is Anki?<br>
                    
                    Anki is a program that helps you remember things more easily. It's like digital flashcards but smarter. It shows you information just before you're likely to forget it, which helps you remember better. You can download Anki for free on most computers and phones, including Linux, Mac, Windows, Android, and iOS. Check it out here. Also, you can find Anki flashcards for lots of different topics on my GitHub repo (link to be added).<br><br>
                    How Does TFA Work?<br>
                    
                    First, you start by studying your lectures and notes. Your goal is to understand the concept as a whole—this is what we call a "black box understanding." Imagine a concept as a big box. You know what goes in and what comes out, but not how it works inside. That's okay for now.
                    <br><br>
                    With TFA, you make Anki flashcards for important terms and their explanations. These terms are like pieces of the puzzle. Each flashcard helps you remember a part of the big picture. Over time, using Anki's smart repetition system, you'll remember these pieces for life.</p>

            </div>
        </div>

        <section class="box">
            <h2>Why U?</h2>
            <p>U stands for Understanding. It's about getting to know the concept inside out. If TFA is about remembering the pieces, U is about knowing how they fit together and work.<br><br>
                Deep Dive with U<br>
                
                U is not about memorization. It's about truly getting the concept. You need to think about how the pieces relate, how they function, and everything in between. This deeper understanding turns the "black box" into a clear picture in your mind.
                <br><br>
                By practicing with exercises, projects, and even discussions or debates, you get closer to what we call "full understanding or wisdom." The more you use and think about the concepts, the better you'll understand them. And this deep understanding is what will help you succeed in exams, your career, and beyond.</p>

                <h2>Focusing Your Unconscious Mind and form intuition</h2>

                <p>Learn hard concepts intuitively and forever, as explained by top competitive programmer Colin Galen. After understanding the foundational principles of TFA (Terms for ANKI) and U (Understand), it's crucial to consider how your unconscious mind plays a role in learning. Colin Galen's video, "<strong>Focusing Your Unconscious Mind: Learn Hard Concepts Intuitively (And Forever)</strong>," sheds light on this aspect of learning, showing how to harness your unconscious to understand and remember complex concepts for the long haul.</p>

                <h3>The Essence of Intuitive Understanding</h3>
                <p>Intuitive understanding is about accepting concepts as fundamental truths, making them so ingrained in your mind that their application becomes second nature. Imagine knowing something so well, like the fact that 2+2 equals 4, that it feels obvious. This level of understanding is what the video aims to help you achieve with all types of concepts.</p>
            
                <h3>Key Strategies for Intuitive Learning</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Generate Insights:</strong> Insights deepen your understanding by connecting experiences with concepts. These "aha" moments make learning stick because they come from a personal place of discovery.</li>
                    <li><strong>Learning as Problem Solving:</strong> Engage your brain's problem-solving skills to tackle new information. This approach makes learning more natural and effective.</li>
                    <li><strong>Care About Your Learning:</strong> Having genuine interest or finding personal motivation in what you're learning is crucial. It makes the process enjoyable and the information more memorable.</li>
                    <li><strong>Understand in Small Pieces:</strong> Don't overwhelm yourself. Break down concepts into manageable chunks to avoid confusion and enhance comprehension.</li>
                    <li><strong>Forget Memorization:</strong> Aim for deep, intuitive understanding rather than rote memorization. This means rewiring your brain to perceive the concept as an undeniable truth.</li>
                </ol>
            
                <h3>The Learning Process</h3>
                <p>Start with a broad understanding of the concept to grasp its significance and context. This big-picture view sets the stage for more detailed exploration. Then, methodically dive into specifics, following a three-step process for each detail: understand it in context, by itself, and then reinforce your understanding.</p>
            
                <h3>Thinking Outside the Magic Box</h3>
                <p>Use the metaphor of a "magic box" to approach learning. First, understand the purpose and function of the whole concept. Then, break it down into its parts, ensuring you grasp how they work together and support the overall concept. This strategy simplifies complex ideas into smaller, understandable pieces.</p>
            
                <h3>Engaging the Unconscious Mind</h3>
                <p>Focusing intensely on a concept signals to your brain that it's important, prompting your unconscious to process it further. This deep engagement helps internalize the concept, making its recall effortless.</p>
            
                <h3>When to Explore Solutions</h3>
                <p>After dedicating effort to understand a problem, look at established solutions or explanations. Break them down and integrate them into your understanding gradually, mirroring the learning process. This methodical approach reinforces what you've learned and ensures long-term retention.</p>
            
                <h3>Reinforcement and Application</h3>
                <p>To solidify your understanding, try to invent the concept, apply it, explain it, and explore related ideas. Each step builds on the last, deepening your comprehension and making the knowledge part of your intuitive thought process.</p>
